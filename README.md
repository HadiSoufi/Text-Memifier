# Text-Memifier
Simple applet made by my friend's request
Turns text of any formatting into meme-style text eg:

    thisIS   an eXaMpL   e
  
Becomes

    T H I S I S A N E X A M P L E
  
There are multiple formatting options, such as default row, row & column, full square, and reversed full square.
